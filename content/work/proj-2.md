Montreal, 2014

I choreographed this piece. It is an exploration of our different filters. I decided to explore who we are while we are alone and who we are with others (being the audience). To do this, I helped my dancer get into an intimate head space with her eyes closed where she then began speaking a 'stream of consciousness'. This is what you hear in the beginning when she is on the ground. When she stands up and starts speaking live, her directions were to speak continuously while reacting to the audience and the space. We used a mixture of set and live movement.
