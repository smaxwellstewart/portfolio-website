Montreal, 2014

I choreographed and danced in this piece. It was an attempt to find comic absurdity in the subjects that we associate with depth and sacredness. I was interested in using the typewriter's rhythm and accordion's musicality to create a narrative where I became a puppet, transforming through riddles and song. It was inspired by a puppet show at a festival that I fell in love with.
