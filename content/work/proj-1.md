Montreal, 2015

My role was an interpreter for choreographer Natalie Schneck.
This piece was reworked material from Spring 2015 that we created in the following summer months to then perform in one of Montreal's biggest cultural centre's Place des Arts. It was my first time being partially nude in a contemporary dance performance and was a beautiful and enriching experience.
