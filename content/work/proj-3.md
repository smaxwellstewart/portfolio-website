Montreal, 2015

My role was interpreter for choreographer Nien Tzu Weng. This piece was a look at what it's like to work with Nien Tzu, chaos and sexual tension with an overarching absurdity. A strong moment in this piece for me is when I embody a character full of passion and hunger while kicking my dancing parter (the choreographer) like a subservient soccer ball.
