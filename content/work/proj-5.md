Montreal, 2014

I choreographed this piece. We were exploring the concept of vulgarity through profane gesture as well as costume and object. We used many different taboo hang gestures from around the world and threw them out to the audience in a playful and fun manner. I had known about the second piece of music for a while and was very pleased with its fit into the dance.
